    <p>To one of the most oldest members of the crew, meet angelcrazy_45 or just angel for short. The yin to my yang and the person who would probblay win a award for most likely to go to jail. Know by many as the NewYork with the sliver touge but love by many. Angel is one of the few people that can make anyone and I truly do mean anyone laugh with just a random sound. He is my right hand man when comes down to anything stream related or outside of stream. Funny thing about this crew member is that we orginal start out as enemys who hate one another, go figure but always go check him out he is probblay someone you need to watch if you need a good laugh.</p>

Though she isnt a youtube livestream she is always streaming over at twitch.tv show her subs and mys new thing such as how to draw and life questions along with a few games here and there. One of her favorite being that of Apex legends or Overwatch you can best to believe she will have you with any kind of healing needed to win the game. so If you havent already go over to twitch and give momma a big hug trust me being the one of 3 girls in the crew isnt that easy.</p>

    <p>The man, the myth, The lenged himself weepygutair90 knows as weepy on most of his stream he is know for mostly 2 things that is stream for 24hours on mutiple days and for consistently stream mutiple days out of the week. For the most of my fan and or subs most watch weepy due to the fact he is the punchline to most of the jokes that we make but through it all weepy is probblay the most successful out all the crew members reach a total of 2k subs. But Dont let it go to his head, always you can expect to see minecraft, Dead by Daylight, A rare new game or 2 . But why example more just go check him out yourself on youtube.</p>
