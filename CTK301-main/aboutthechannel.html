<p class="p1">Oh, So you you wanna know about your's truly where can I start, Well for the most part im 23 years old. Im from chicago Illionis and I love music trust me when it comes down to music im your guy to go to when you want hear something good. For the most part during this time I only been on youtube as a creator for about year now and I can say without a doubt i have done alot in that year. For starters I been notice and followed by a pretty big youbtuber know as Troydan who stand at a grand total of 10million subs and counting. I have also been the fast and truly do mean fastest growing channel on the plateform in a long time. Throught my travels in youtube I have meet alot of people some who have came and gone and other who have stayed and join this wonderful thing i like to call my crew. The crew was made for people who were alike and want someone to play with which later turn into the people who im always streaming with. These guys are to me my family and in a way to them im like there father someone who at there lowest point came in when was needed and turn a bunch of random weridos into something geater. Pushing the idea that anybody can be the next big thing and showing them they have to go the distance. Along with that I came up with a vow which is for anybody who didnt have a voice or couldnt speak up I would be there outlit. Thru this crazy jorney I have made some many differant fans and friends someone even help me grow till this day and wanna see me go beyond my limits and reach for the stars. So that my story and trust me while writing this a chapter or 2 might have already been write in the book of my life. SO what are you wait for go Hit the video and join in on the fun with me.</p>
